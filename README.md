# Metrify
A iOS metronome

This app not only is a metronome, but it also contains some code from Beat-Tapper (https://github.com/MrKai77/Beat-Tapper) to translate your taps into BPM.

If you want to install this app on your phone, simply download the Metrify folder, then compile the xcodeproj file onto your phone using Xcode 12+.
